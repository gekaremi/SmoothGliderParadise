# Totally Based on SmoothLife
(even readme)

"Generalization of Conway's "Game of Life" to a continuous domain - SmoothLife"

Written in Python using `numpy` and explained (hopefully) without too much fancy math.

https://github.com/duckythescientist/SmoothLife

It is realllyy awesome

# but now with using PyQtGraph
Scientific Graphics and GUI Library for Python

https://github.com/pyqtgraph/pyqtgraph

Especially scripts examples ImageItem.py and Draw.py

and this is too

But I think (probably mistakenly) that it would be nice to add the ability to draw and use a faster library than matplotlib(and matplotlib is still incredibly wonderful).

## Running

### Requirements

* 'Python 3'
